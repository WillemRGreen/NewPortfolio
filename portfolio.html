                        Here is a project of mine called Your TBR

                    <p>
                        It is used by avid readers to keep track of books that they want to read. I read a lot, and often forget the books that I've noted to read later, this helps a lot. Then, once you've finished reading a book, you can mark it as read and the pplication will keep track of all the books you've marked in the app, on your progress page.

                        Another project of mine I am proud of is called Brewer's Guide
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This app was made with another hobby of mine in mind: specialty coffee brewing. I used to be a apecialty coffee tasting professional, and I designed this app to help beginner specialty brewer's get started. One of the common problems in the coffee world is getting your specs for each brew right, and this app does that for you. You just have to enter your desired amount of coffee, and some info about the coffee in question, and the app will calculate the rest for you. Then it will save that brew for you to be adjusted whenever you want, according to your tasting judgment.

                    <p>
                        This app was made by me in my time at Thinkful to practice working with data structures and algorithms. It uses a basic algorithm in combination with a linked queue, to help users memorize french words.
